# petfolio

## Passport for Your Pet:

Your petâ€™s medical history on the blockchain so you can access it anywhere.


====
This was a difficult project for us to build in 72 hours. We did the best we can to demonstrate a proof of concept, and meet the minimum qualification of deploying a blockchain application from our local development environment with multiple docker containers to a live server.

The potential for this project is much bigger than the demo we are able to technically implement in this short time.
